# Regex Tutorial 

Regex, short for Regular Expression, is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. It is commonly used for string matching and string replacement. Regex is supported in many programming languages, such as JavaScript, Python, and C#. In this tutorial, we will follow an example code snippet that can be used to match an email address.
