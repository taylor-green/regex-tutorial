# Regex Tutorial 

Regex, short for Regular Expression, is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. It is commonly used for string matching and string replacement. Regex is supported in many programming languages, such as JavaScript, Python, and C#. In this tutorial, we will follow an example code snippet that can be used to match an email address.

## Summary

The following code will be used throughout the tutorial to give specific examples for how the components of regex can be used. The following code can be used for matching emails. One use for this code is that it can be used to validate to make sure that an email follows the correct format.

Matching Email-

/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/

## Regex Components

### Anchors

The anchor is what starts and ends the regular expression. In the matching email code,

/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/,

the anchors are the ^ and the $. This code specifically is saying that we are looking for something that starts with

^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)

we will define what everything inside the parentheses later in this tutorial, but what the anchor means is that if we are to find a match it has follow those initial guidelines. It also has to end with

.([a-z\.]{2,6})$.

So, it must start and end with the given parameters within the code. If it does not, then it is not a match.


### Quantifiers

A quantifier is used to determine how many times a specific character or group of characters needs to be present in order to have a match. For instance, if we used the following code in our regex, xyz+ then this will match any string xy followed by at least one z. So, if we look at our code for matching the email:

([a-z0-9_\.-]+)

this will match any string that contains a-z, 0-9, _, ., or -. The quantifier + means that it has to contain at least one of this in order to have a match.

### OR Operator

It is not present in the code for the given matching email code, but in order to talk about the OR Operator, we will look at the following code for matching a hex code.

/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/

 This is a regex for matching a hex code that uses the OR Operator. What this will do is it will match where it starts with the # and that has to come first followed by one of the following:

[a-f0-9]{6} which will match a 6 character long string that contains a combination of a-f letters and 0-9 numbers.

| OR Operator

[a-f0-9]{3} it will match a 3 character long string that contains a combination of a-f letters and 0-9 numbers.
